**Singapore is one of the cleanest cities with a good environmental public health system. However, we remain vulnerable to evolving public health threats.**
 
SG Clean is a proactive response to minimise the spread of COVID-19, and to make cleanliness a way of life in Singapore. The campaign aims to raise hygiene standards and keep public spaces clean and safe for everyone.
 
**Join our SG Clean Ambassador Network and help to promote the SG Clean habits and social norms.** 

Through SG Clean, we will build confidence with our people that if we all if we do this together, Singapore will be cleaner and safer!
