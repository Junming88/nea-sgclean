**We all dine differently.<br>
But let’s remember to clean up after ourselves!** <br>

**What is Table Litter?** <br>

•	Used tissues and wipes <br>
•	Disposable cutlery and containers <br>
•	Food remnants such as bones and shells< br>
•	Straws and wrappers <br>
•	Canned drinks and plastic bottles <br>

**How can we do our part?**<br>
•	Keep the table clean for the next diner <br>
•	Clear your table litter <br>
•	Return your trays and crockery <br>

Every diner deserves a clean table. Let’s be gracious and keep our hawker centres, coffeeshops and food courts clean and safe. <br>
