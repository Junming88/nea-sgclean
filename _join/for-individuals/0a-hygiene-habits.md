#### Everyone can play a part in keeping themselves and others around them safe by adopting good personal habits. NEA has been encouraging â€œ[7 Habits of Good Public Hygiene](https://www.nea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/our-services/public-cleanliness/covid-19/7hygienehabits-english.pdf)", which include:

1. Washing hands frequently with soap and taking temperature daily.

2. Using a tissue whenever sneezing or coughing, and binning own litter and soiled tissues. This will prevent individuals from adversely affecting the health and well-being of family, friends, colleagues and those around them.

3. Keeping public toilets clean and dry. This will reduce the risk of spreading diseases and viruses such as COVID-19 and dengue within the community.
