> ### These measures to elevate cleanliness and public hygiene in Singapore will help safeguard public health. NEA hopes to sustain the campaign beyond the current outbreak of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019), and make keeping Singapore clean a way of life.

##  ** 7 Habits of Good Public Hygiene”**

Members of the public are encouraged to adopt the following “seven habits” of good public hygiene practices at all times:  
  
1. Keep premises clean and pest-free;  
2. Return tray and keep table clean;  
3. Keep toilet clean and dry;  
4. Wash hands regularly with soap;  
5. Take temperature and see doctor if unwell;  
6. Use tissue when sneezing or coughing; and  
7. Bin litter and soiled tissue.

## SG Clean Quality Mark

Those with the “SG Clean” quality mark will have their premises audited by agencies or appointed third-party assessors, and will have to commit and adhere to sector-specific sanitation and hygiene checklists, covering areas such as management oversight, cleaning methodology, toilet cleanliness, and general public hygiene.  
  
The “SG Clean” quality mark will first be rolled out to hawker centres, and will be progressively rolled out to various sectors, covering premises with high human traffic such as:  
- train stations and bus interchanges,  
- preschools, schools,  
- government buildings,  
- hotels, conference venues, tourist attractions,  
- cruise and ferry terminals, airport terminals,  
- the integrated resorts,  
- shopping malls and F&B outlets.

## Ground-up efforts

Grassroots organisations (GROs) and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) such as the Public Hygiene Council (PHC), Restroom Association of Singapore (RAS), and the Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) will leverage their networks to rally the community to take ownership and commit to upholding good personal and environmental hygiene practices.

## Sustaining Good Habits

While the “SG Clean” campaign will help to reduce any public health risks from the current COVID-19 situation, the longer-term objective is to instil greater awareness of good hygiene and cleaning practices, and to ensure that these are sustained at high levels beyond the current outbreak of COVID-19.  
  
Through collective action by all stakeholders, we can contribute towards safeguarding public health and making Singapore a cleaner, more liveable and pleasant environment for all.
