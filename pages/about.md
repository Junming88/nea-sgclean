### About SG Clean

*Concerted action needed from everyone to elevate cleanliness and public hygiene standards and make them the new norms.*
  
Launched on 16 February 2020 by the National Environment Agency (NEA), the SG Clean campaign seeks to rally stakeholders and members of the public to do their part, by adopting good personal habits and social responsibility, to raise standards of cleanliness and public hygiene in Singapore and safeguard public health.

It is envisioned that the SG Clean campaign will instil a national “keep clean culture”, where keeping Singapore clean is an integral part of our lives.
